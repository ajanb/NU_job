Geometry Optimization of Inertial Reactive Armour (IRA)

IRA is an add-on type of armour mainly used on battle tanks, you can see from pictures how they are equipped with boxes on the outside.
Inside these boxes there are rotating discs, which then deflects the hitting projectile. In order to increase the probability of deflection we need find the optimal layout for the armour.

This folder contains the main codes for the computation of the necessary parameters.
